# Project Objective:
### Business growth analysis is essential for any company that wants to remain competitive and successful in the long term.

The goal is to write effective SQL queries to answer 10 ad-hoc business requests from the Data Analytics Director, aiming to secure valuable insights into the consumer goods sector. 
By fulfilling these different ad-hoc requests, I delivered specific answers to important business questions enabling the company to understand its product portfolio, sales trends across diverse customer segments and a monthly overview of products sold.
